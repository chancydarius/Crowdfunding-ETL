# Crowdfunding-ETL
The purpose of Crowdfunding ETL is to help Independent Funding, a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures, move all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. Where the we will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects.
Specifically, we extracted and transformed the backers data from a large Excel file into separate CSV files. We then created a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD. We also loaded the CSV files into the database and then executed SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders.
